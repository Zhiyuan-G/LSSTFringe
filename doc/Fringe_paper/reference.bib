abstract = {An updated tabulation is presented of the optical properties of intrinsic silicon, of particular interest in solar cell calculations. Improved values of absorption coefficient, refractive index and extinction coefficient at 300K are tabulated over the 0.25–1.45μm wavelength range at 0.01μm intervals. The self-consistent tabulation was derived from Kramers–Kronig analysis of updated reflectance data deduced from the literature. The inclusion of normalised temperature coefficients allows extrapolation over a wide temperature range, with accuracy similar to that of available experimental data demonstrated over the −24°C to 200°C range.}
